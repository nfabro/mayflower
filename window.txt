Our window cleaning service includes washing the inside and outside of the glass pane, as well as wiping the frames and sills, 
		as long as they are made from PVC.  
		For internal windows, we use ladder, when necessary and manually clean the glass with traditional tools and accessories. When you book bond cleaning
		or after builders cleaning with us, the cleaning of the windows from inside is included.
		External windows are usually cleaned with purified water, supplied by us, which is fed through an extension pole. 
		The glass dries naturally, streak-free, as all water impurities and minerals are filtered out prior to washing. The technique is an effective method
		for eliminating stains and excessive dust build-up from exterior windows. It is also a recommended cleaning solution for hard-to-reach windows, located up
		to the fourth floor.
		In addition, our high-rise window cleaning experts can be booked for servicing multi-storey buildings, where safety equipment and abseiling gear is 
		employed. The cleaning professionals are carefully vetted and comprehensively insured, hence they undertake each job with the confidence of a pro.
